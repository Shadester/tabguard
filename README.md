## Usage

### Via Popup (Click Extension Icon)

The popup has two tabs:

**Locks Tab** - Main controls
- **Lock Both** button - Lock/unlock both Page and Tab simultaneously
- **Page Lock** toggle - Prevents navigation only
- **Tab Lock** toggle - Prevents closing only

**Settings Tab** - Link behavior (Page Lock only)
- **Global Default** - Control whether blocked links open in new tabs (affects all tabs)
- **Override for This Tab** - Customize behavior for just the current tab

### Via Right-Click Menu
1. Right-click anywhere on the page
2. Select "Toggle Page Lock" or "Toggle Tab Lock"
3. Or select "Unlock All" to remove all locks

### Via Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` (or `Cmd+Shift+L` on Mac) - Toggle Page Lock
- `Ctrl+Shift+K` (or `Cmd+Shift+K` on Mac) - Toggle Tab Lock

### On-Page Indicator
When Page Lock is active:
- A blue banner appears at the top: "ðŸ”’ Page Locked - Click to unlock"
- Click the banner to open the extension popup
- Click the "âˆ’" button to minimize it to a corner icon
- Click the minimized icon to expand it again

## How It Works

- **Page Lock**:
  - Intercepts navigation events and redirects back to the locked URL
  - Same-page hash navigation is allowed
  - Optionally opens blocked links in new tabs
  - Visual on-page banner for clear feedback
- **Tab Lock**:
  - Detects tab close events and immediately reopens the tab
  - Preserves URL and lock state
- **Lock states**:
  - Persisted in Chrome's local storage
  - Survive browser restarts
- **No passwords**: Simple toggle on/off for quick use

## Troubleshooting

### Page Lock isn't working
- Make sure the Page Lock toggle is ON (green)
- Check if the on-page banner is visible
- Some websites may prevent the extension from working (e.g., chrome:// pages)

### Links still navigate away
- Check Settings tab - "Global Default" should be ON if you want links to open in new tabs
- Make sure you're clicking regular links (not form submissions or JavaScript events)

### Tab Lock reopens in wrong position
- This is a browser limitation - reopened tabs appear at the end
- The tab will maintain its URL and lock state

### Extension not appearing
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- Try reloading the extension
- Check that all files were extracted from the zip

### Keyboard shortcuts not working
- Check chrome://extensions/shortcuts to see if shortcuts are configured
- Some shortcuts may conflict with browser or OS shortcuts
- You can customize shortcuts in chrome://extensions/shortcuts
